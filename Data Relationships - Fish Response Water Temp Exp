# Consider the relationship between change in body weight and food intake with evaluation of distributional properties of each variable
# Density plot and variable Distribution
plot(density(Tom$dW))                                                        # Density plot for body weight
plot(density(Tom$FoodIntake.mg))                                             # Density plot for food intake 

# Body weight density plot is right skewed
# Indicates that the mean is greater than the median value and there is a possibility for outliers
# We would expect large weight gain but not negative gain
# Skew is in part because it is 'bounded' on one side

# Food intake density plot is trimodal
# The tri-modal distribution is likely due to the experimental design
# Likely the result of there being three length classes in the experiment and on average larger classes consume more food

# Scatterplot
plot(Tom$FoodIntake.mg,Tom$dW)                                               # Scatter plot

# Relationship between the two variables
# There is a linear and strong positive association between food intake and change in body weight
# The association is stronger at lower food intake indicating and weaker at higher intake and body weight change so strength is partial
# There is the possiblity of one outlier


# Quantify the association between dW and FoodIntake.mg
cor(Tom$dW, Tom$FoodIntake.mg)                                             # Correlation 2-variables

# The calculated correlation value of 0.95 is greater than 0 towards 1 therefore we can imply a strong positive association between the change in weight and food intake
# Based on the scatterplot, the correlation coefficient a valid description of the association between the change in weight and food intake
# The correlation is slightly less valid considering that the distribution is stronger at lower points between the x and y axis
# It is still strong towards higher numbers but slightly weaker
# The correlation coefficient is valid but the scatterplot tells more information


# Water temperature affects on growth (not using multiple explanatory variables)
# Scatter plot of dW and FoodIntake.mg by (conditional on) water temperature level (WT).
scatterplot(dW~FoodIntake.mg, groups=Tom$WT, data=Tom, regLine=TRUE,

# The conditional scatterplot implies that at the lowest temperatures, there is little food intake and little growth
# As temperature increases it appears the slope of the best-fit-line may decrease
# This indicates that at higher water temperatures food intake has less of an effect on growth

# Proportion of fish jointly had an above average change in weight and were in the 18 ˚C water temperature treatment is 0.102
# Proportion of fish were in the 12 ˚C water temperature treatment is 0.167
# Proportion of fish had below average growth conditional on being in a treatment with water temperatures greater than 17 ˚C is 0.239
